# 6502

This is a project for an emulator for the MOS 6502 microprocessor. The MOS 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor that was very popular in the 70s an 80s. It was used in many computer systems and game consoles, including the Apple II, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), the Commodore 64, and many others.

## Current Features 

The emulator currently implements the following features:

1. Opcode decoding (little).
2. Addressing modes (complete/bugged).
3. Instruction execution (partial/buggy).

## Future Features

In the final version of the emulator, i plan to implement the following features:

1. Complete instrucion set.
2. Clock cycles (frequency).
3. Compatibily: be able to run real 6502 programs an games on the emulator.

## How to Use the emulator

You need to load a program into the emulator's memory and then start then program execution.

### Observation

This project is a fun hobby that I enjoy an is not intended for any future aspirations. It's simply tool for me to practice and improve my skills.

#### ObservationÂ²

The comments in the code that are not in English are possibly lines that I made only for testing purposes an will be removed in the future.
